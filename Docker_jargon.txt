Key Terms - Docker

Base Image: 	A set of common dependencies built into a Docker image that acts as a starting point to build an application’s Docker images to reduce build times

Container:	Grouped software dependencies and packages that make it easier and more reliable to deploy software

Container Registry:	A centralized place to store container images

Docker-compose:	A tool used to run multiple Docker containers at once; often used to specify dependent relationships between containers

Dockerfile:	A file containing instructions on how to translate an application into an image that can be run in containers

Ephemeral:	Software property where an application is expected to be short-lived

Image:	A snapshot of dependencies and code used by Docker containers to run an application
